# HTML-Calculator
This is a calculator...Made with HTML!

# Notes:
*BEFORE OPENING PLEASE PUT ALL OF THESE FILES IN A FOLDER. I DIDIN'T PUT THEM IN A ZIP FILE.*

Right now we have addition (index.html), subtraction, multiplication, and division
It should be easy to open the files, just double-click the files and your default browser will open.
The style could be 100 times better just that i dont know how to make it like that.
